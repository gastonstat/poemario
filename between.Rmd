# Between {-}

Between the mountains and the buildings<br>
I choose the freedom of the summits.<br>
Between tequila and huitlacoche<br>
I choose the fungus of the corn.<br>
Between Kingdom and Republic<br>
I choose to party in California.<br>
Between the jukebox and the kitchen<br>
I choose to help the master chef.<br>
Between scientists and brokers<br>
there is more meaning in the lab.
